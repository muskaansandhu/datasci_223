Hello, my name is Muskaan Sandhu and I am a student in DataSci223! For this exercise, I worked with Shreya Sreeram and Ritika Batte. 

Here is the link to exercise #1, Making the grade: https://github.com/muskaansandhu/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb 

This code was written in a Jupyter notebook in VS code. The code includes the outputs of the examples that were mentioned in the exercise to ensure that the code was running correctly. 

The only difficulty I had was with exercise 4. It took me a bit to determine how to calculate the grades and include only the lower ends of the threshold in the output of the code.
