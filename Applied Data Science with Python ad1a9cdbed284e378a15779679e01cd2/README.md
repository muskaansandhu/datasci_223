Hello, my name is Muskaan Sandhu and I am a student in DataSci223! I am looking forward to learning more of the basic about Python in this course since I have no prior experience with the language. 

In this course, I will be working with Shreya Sreeram, Ritika Batte, and Soha Shahidi. 

EXERCISE 1: 

Here is the link to exercise #1, Making the grade: https://github.com/muskaansandhu/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/1-foundations/exercise.ipynb 

This code was written in a Jupyter notebook in VS code. The code includes the outputs of the examples that were mentioned in the exercise to ensure that the code was running correctly. 

The only difficulty I had was with exercise 4. It took me a bit to determine how to calculate the grades and include only the lower ends of the threshold in the output of the code. 

EXERCISE 2: 

Here is the link to exericise #2, Dirty_EMNIST: https://github.com/muskaansandhu/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/2-data-munging/exercise-dirty_emnist.ipynb

This code was written in a Jupyter notebook in VS code. For this exercise, I went ahead and identified rows that included specific values which would indicate whether or not the data had been dirtied and dropped them from the data set. I found that going through the code that had been written to dirty the data set and working backwards was very heplful to determine which rows to remove. 

EXERCISE 3: 

Here is the link to exercise #3, Excercise_Chinook: https://github.com/muskaansandhu/datasci_223/blob/main/exercises/3-sql-queries/exercise.ipynb


This code was written in Jupyter notebook in VS code. To run the code, you need to import pandas and sqlite3. For this exercise, the diagram provided the exercise_3 folder was very helpful for visualizing how the data was set up and made it easier to complete the exercise. 

Exercise 4:
